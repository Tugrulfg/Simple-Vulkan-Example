# Vulkan Example in C
In the example, I used VK_KHR_DISPLAY_EXTENSION_NAME. This extension makes Vulkan directly display the image on the screen without using any windowing system support.

To run this example on your Ubuntu computer, first switch to tty3 mode with Ctrl+Alt+f3. Then you can run the executable file.
